Identify the Conflict: Git will inform you when a conflict occurs during a merge, showing conflicting lines in the file.

Edit the Conflicting File: Open the file and look for the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>). These markers separate the changes from each branch.

Choose a Conflict Resolution Strategy: Manually merge the changes, combining parts from both versions.

Mark the Conflict as Resolved: Once youâ€™ve resolved the conflict, stage the changes with git add.

Commit the Merge Resolution: Complete the merge with git commit
